Manifesto is an all-purpose "toolbox" app for working with Jamf. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* It is a collection of features that I felt would be useful for a Jamf admin to have in an app form.

* It has grown organically based on my own needs as a Jamf admin. 

* It is particularly helpful for working with Jamf whilst travelling or with an unstable network connection.

* It can really help with repetitive tasks in Jamf and brings together features that are spread over multiple pages in the website.


For a full list of the features and the introductory movie see the man1festo Wiki here: https://ethamoos.co.uk/manifesto-wiki/

Some Feature Hightlights:

* Enable and disable policies
* Edit the content (packages and scripts) of policies
* Edit the scoping of policies
* Add and remove a device from a static group via a simple interface
* Check prestage membership from a simple interface
* Move devices between pre-stages from a simple interface
* Create items from a simple interface (static group, dept, category, policy etc)﻿
* Quickly create policies with lots of packages (much quicker than in the web interface) from a single screen
* Edit policies and update objects whilst on the move
* Provide controlled access items in Jamf within a simplified graphical interface
* Intuitively make changes to Jamf without full knowledge of all aspects
