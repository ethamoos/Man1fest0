Manifesto is an all-purpose "toolbox" app for working with Jamf. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* It is a collection of features that I felt would be useful for a Jamf admin to have in an app form.

* It is not designed to access every feature of Jamf but has grown organically based on my own needs as a Jamf admin. 

* It can particularly help with repetitive tasks in Jamf and brings together features that are spread over multiple pages.

* It can be used for some tasks when you either don't have access to a computer, or have a stable browser connection such as whilst on the move.


For a full list of the features and the introductory movie see the man1festo Wiki here: https://ethamoos.co.uk/manifesto-wiki/

Some Feature Hightlights:

* Enable and disable policies
* Edit the content (packages and scripts) of policies

* Add and remove a device from a static group via a simple interface
* Check prestage membership from a simple interface
* Move devices between pre-stages from a simple interface
* Create items from a simple interface (static group, dept, category, policy etc)ï»¿
* Quickly create policies with lots of packages (much quicker than in the web interface) from a single screen
* Edit policies and update objects whilst on the move
* Provide controlled access items in Jamf within a simplified graphical interface
